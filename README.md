Introduction to 1D Array

Array:
It is a set of homogeneous Data Elements.

Need of Array:
If we want to find greatest of But what if we want to find the greatest of 100 numbers.3 numbers then we can define 3 variables like x, y, z. In this case using array will be convenient for us.

How to define an array:
int x[100];
Here we can assume that we have defined 100 integer variables i.e.
x[0], x[1], x[2], ………, x[99]

Some important points:
•	We have started counting from 0 and not from 1 i.e. 1st variable is x[0] and not x[1].
•	All these variables are independent of each other i.e. changing one will not change the other.
•	int x[100]; here int is the Datatype of every element, x is the name of the array, 100 is the no. of elements in the array.
•	In variables x[0], x[5], etc. 0 and 5 are called subscript.
•	Homogeneous means all elements of array will have same datatype.
•	Array is a static data structure i.e. 1st we have to define its size and only then we use it.
